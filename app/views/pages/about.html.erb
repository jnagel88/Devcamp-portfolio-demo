<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  After working in the theatre and live entertainment industry for more than a decade, working with clients from the production aspect, from the venue aspect as well as from the designerâ€™s aspect, I have gained a unique perspective on client relations and communications.

<p>
  Wanting to expand my love of puzzles and logic, I decided to transition to software development to not only explore software development, but to bring my passion for puzzles, logic and communication to others.

  In an ever changing industry, you have to be willing to always be a student. And to that end, I spend a good portion of my spare time building projects or reading about new technologies, techniques, and methods in order to always improve my own skills, but to also teach others what I have learned.
